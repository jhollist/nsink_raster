# Create

# Create: removal raster
- Land removal
- Lake removal
- Stream removal

- notes: generate at 10m, filter, re-scale to 30m
  - need explanation/example as to why this is good...

---
# Create: type raster
- start with removal rasters and convert positive removal values to a type

---
# Create: Combine removal and type
- raster stack

---
# Create: Flowpath

# Now what?

---
# Now what?: Static Maps
- Which static maps to create?
- Brute force
- Something else?
  - Flow accumulation?

---
# Now what?: R Package
- Code for doing this is a hot-mess
- R package is obvious solution
- Facilitates use with other tools
  - e.g. ArcGIS R Bridge

---
# Now what?: Web UI
- Stay in R?
  - Shiny
- ArcGIS?
  - Would need to use R Bridge for Arc
    - <https://r-arcgis.github.io/>
  - Or...
  - Re-work some portion of the workflow
    - Flow path generation
    - Extracting
    - Summarizing
