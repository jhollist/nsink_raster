# Clean

---

#Clean: Specific HUC

- NHD+ is for all of New England
- Narrow down to Specific HUC 12 
- Niantic as example

---

#Clean: Raster Conformity

- Rasters will have small differences
- Need to force to same origin and projection

# Acquire and Clean: Miscellany

- As currently written:
  - Provides NHD+ data for all of New England
  - Gets impervious and SSURGO for specific HUC
  - Cache data locally
  - Takes ~ 15 minutes for all of this
    - 90% of that is downloading SSURGO

# Create 

---
# Create: removal raster
- Land removal
- Lake removal
- Stream removal

- notes: generate at 10m, filter, re-scale to 30m
  - need explanation/example as to why this is good...


---
# Create: Land removal

- SSURGO hydric soils
- Impervious Surface masked out
- Combine
  - Spatial map units 
  - Non-spatial components 
    - Hydric/Not hydric
    - Percent hydric
- Output
  - Polygons with total percent hydric
- Rasterize
  - Pixel value = total percent hydric

# Now what?

---
# Now what?: Static Maps
- Which static maps to create?
- Brute force
- Something else?
  - Flow accumulation?

---
# Now what?: R Package
- Code for doing this is a hot-mess
- R package is obvious solution
- Facilitates use with other tools
  - e.g. ArcGIS R Bridge

---
# Now what?: Web UI
- Stay in R?
  - Shiny
- ArcGIS?
  - Would need to use R Bridge for Arc
    - <https://r-arcgis.github.io/>
  - Or...
  - Re-work some portion of the workflow
    - Flow path generation
    - Extracting
    - Summarizing
