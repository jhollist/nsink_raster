# General Notes

- need two rasters 
    - relative load/removal
        - this will be the trick for all of this
        - Q's idea for lakes:
            - All lake pixels == 0
            - outlet of lake (along artifical flowpath) has removal
    - flow path (are we doing this just for a single flow path or ALL possible flow paths)
- Use flow path to get load/removal values along flow path
    - First pixel is starting relative load
    - Convert to vector with [1] = initial load and [n] = end of flow path
    - use `cumprod()` to get total reduction
    - What to use for flow path?
        - Can we force `gdistance::shortestPath()` some how?
        - Might need to dig into [TauDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/downloads.html)
- Other notes:
    - `raster::terrain()` returns flow direction
    - not clear if flow accumulation is available (won't need for individual path)
        - `gdistance::accCost()` might work
